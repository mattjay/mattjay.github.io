Over the last two decades, I’ve helped make hundreds of organizations more secure.

My mission is to leave the Internet a more secure place than I found it.

I’m helping organizations handle billions of users' information securely and increasing brand’s trust among their customers.

I’m currently the Security Architect of Reddit.

My portfolio:

→ I’m the security architect of Reddit where I help design security into all facets of the business for the 4th largest social network in the US and a top 20 most visited website globally

→ I teach company’s how to protect against cyber attacks and save tens of millions of dollars in losses.

→ I coach entrepreneurs and CISOs that need help with infrastructure, application, cloud, and security policies.

→ I advise early-stage companies in cyber security best practices and help pass technical due diligence from investors and potential acquirers.

→ I invest in early-stage private technology companies focusing on cybersecurity, software infrastructure, employee productivity, and B2B/SaaS.

→ I volunteer for a selection of non-profits who’s missions I connect with who wouldn’t otherwise be able to afford technical and specifically security consulting services..

My results:

→ 50,000k+ applications with less vulnerabilities than when I found them

→ 1B+ users data security reliant on systems I designed or secured

→ $100M+ of startup exits using my security due diligence

→ 0 advertisements or cold calls

→ 100% due diligence success rate

> What if, by embracing our vulnerabilities and openly acknowledging the gaps in our knowledge, we could build stronger and more resilient defenses?
