title: Mentoring
---
I believe that direct connections between real people are transformative, no matter how brief, humble, or insignificant they sometimes appear.

Without the people who have guided, supported, questioned, and encouraged me along the way, many of the experiences I deeply treasure would simply not have happened, and I would not be who I am today. Because of this, it’s important to me that I pay it forward, so I’d like to make myself available in a mentoring capacity to anyone who genuinely believes they would benefit from sharing my feedback, advice, experiences, or guidance.

I don’t profess to be the world’s best example to follow in any respect, however I’m lucky enough to have had an number of incredible opportunities and experiences come my way.

* I have worked my way up through the ranks of Application Security researchers since leaving college
* In 2010 I got hired for my dream job working  for [WhiteHat Security](https://whitehatsec.com), an Application Security company where I went form entry level to be a Sr. Manager in our TRC which is over 150 appsec engineers and researchers, and then on to the Director of Security Services & Research building out new product & service offerings
* My experience and connections have helped me become the Director of Security building a security program for a Financial Tech Startup in Downtown Austin
* I’ve lived and traveled throughout the country, learning new things along the way. (Long Island, NY -> Bay Area, CA -> Houston, TX -> Austin, TX).
* I've spoken at a large number of industry conferences including BlackHat, DEFCON, RSA, SXSW, many BSides and OWASP events, and [others](http://mattjay.github.io/talks/).

If you’d like to work together, you can [write me a letter](mailto:matt@mattjay.com) responding to the questions below; I’ll write back to all letters I receive in this way within two weeks, no matter what. In response to the most exceptional letters, I’ll propose further correspondence—and in certain cases, an ongoing mentoring relationship.

* Tell me about yourself. What do you do? What are your goals?
* What do you hope to gain from our mentoring relationship?
* What’s the most interesting thing you’ve come across to lately?
* What’s the achievement you’re most proud of so far in whatever it is you do?
* Add links to any profiles or projects you’re proud of, and send it to me.

I look forward to learning together.
