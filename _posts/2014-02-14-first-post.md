title: My First New Post
---

Thanks to the kindness of [Scott Roberts](https://twitter.com/sroberts) and our DFIR crew, my laziness has been supported and he open sourced his blog so that I could just fork it and create my own. Expect some nonsense here that might mirror the [WhiteHat Blog](https://blog.whitehatsec.com), but more so will be my avenue to talk about side projects.

I'm hoping to share:

* Some developing ideas
* Projects I've been working on
* Improve my writing
* Things I've been learning/trying to learn
* And responding in longer form to a few other folks on the Internet

So hit me up on Twitter ([@mattjay](https://twitter.com/mattjay)) and let me know what you think.

(Almost all of this is stolen from Scott, he started well and I'm hoping to follow in his footsteps and share similar things.)
