# Navigating the Shift in Cybersecurity: A Commentary on Phil Venables' Insights

Greetings, cybersecurity aficionados! Today, we're taking a deep dive into the [insightful post by Phil Venables](https://www.philvenables.com/post/delivering-security-at-scale-from-artisanal-to-industrial), a renowned cybersecurity expert, and my former boss, on the transition from artisanal to industrial approaches in cybersecurity. I'll be adding my own commentary and interpretations to his points, so let's get started!

## The Artisanal vs. Industrial Paradigm

Venables introduces an interesting dichotomy in cybersecurity: artisanal versus industrial. The artisanal approach, while often high-quality, is heavily reliant on individual performance. It's like a master chef creating a gourmet dish, where the outcome is dependent on their unique skills and knowledge. But as we all know, a master chef can only prepare a limited number of dishes at a time.

We've all worked in teams like this. I covered this in a previous post on [superhero driven culture](https://www.mattjay.com/blog/superhero-incident-response).

The industrial approach, on the other hand, is akin to a high-tech, automated kitchen. It's not about diminishing the role of skilled individuals, but rather about amplifying their capabilities and ensuring consistent, high-quality outcomes at scale. It's about moving from the craftsmanship of a single chef to a well-oiled kitchen that can serve thousands of perfect dishes every day.

In my view, this analogy encapsulates the evolution we need in cybersecurity. As our insfrastructure grows, we need to ensure that our security measures can scale accordingly, and that requires an industrial approach.

## The Power of Pareto Metrics

Venables introduces the concept [in this previous post](https://www.philvenables.com/post/10-fundamental-but-really-hard-security-metrics) of Pareto Metrics, which he defines as the metrics that not only reduce risk and improve processes but also drive scale, performance, and accountability. They're the 20% of metrics that drive 80% of the outcomes you want.

Examples of Pareto Metrics include software reproducibility, infrastructure reproducibility, software lifecycle maturity, and preventative maintenance, among others. These metrics might be challenging to measure, but they're worth the effort.

I couldn't agree more on this point. In the world of cybersecurity, where threats are constantly evolving, we need metrics that can guide us towards the most impactful actions. Pareto Metrics provide a roadmap for focusing our efforts where they can make the most difference.

## Leveraging Inherent Forces

Venables also talks about tapping into inherent forces or megatrends that can naturally aid your journey towards industrialization. For instance, software-defined infrastructure and software deployment velocity are two such forces that can significantly enhance your security program's scalability.

I find this point particularly compelling. In a rapidly changing digital environment, it's crucial to leverage existing trends and technologies to our advantage. By aligning our strategies with these megatrends, we can make our journey towards industrialization smoother and more efficient.

## Emphasizing Continuous Control Monitoring and Control Reliability Engineering

An industrialized security program, according to Venables, needs to know the real-time state of all its required controls and adapt in response to any detected failures. This is where Continuous Control Monitoring and Control Reliability Engineering come intoplay.

This is a crucial point that resonates with me. In cybersecurity, being proactive is key. By continuously monitoring our controls and ensuring their reliability, we can detect potential issues before they escalate into serious threats.

## Prioritizing Business Service and Mission Assurance

Finally, Venables emphasizes that the ultimate goal of an industrialized program is to ensure that your set of business services or missions operate securely and reliably. This requires adopting an operational resilience mindset, identifying and ranking critical business services, and integrating continuous controls monitoring performance and wider sets of metrics.

I wholeheartedly agree with this point. At the end of the day, the goal of cybersecurity is to protect our business services and missions. By focusing on operational resilience, we can ensure that our cybersecurity measures are not just effective, but also aligned with our business objectives.

Wrapping up - Venables' post offers a compelling roadmap for scaling cybersecurity programs. His insights on the shift from artisanal to industrial, the importance of Pareto Metrics, leveraging inherent forces, the emphasis on continuous control monitoring, and the focus on business service and mission assurance are all critical points that resonate with me.

It's clear that we need to move beyond individual excellence and towards a more scalable, predictable, and reliable approach. This doesn't mean diminishing the role of skilled individuals, but rather amplifying their capabilities to ensure consistent, high-quality outcomes at scale.

Venables' post serves as a valuable guide for this journey, and I believe his insights have ben and will continue to be instrumental in shaping the future of cybersecurity. As we continue to face new challenges and threats, it's clear that the journey from artisanal to industrial is not just necessary, but also exciting and rewarding. Happy scaling!
